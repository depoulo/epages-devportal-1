Every programmer has his own definition, base line, and ways to maintain what they'll call "code quality".
But when working on a shared code base, with multiple teams and from multiple locations, processes and tools are crucial
for developing a common understanding of that abstract term, and constantly ensuring it.

Let's look at some textbook best practices, and compare them to the results of an internal survey I conducted among all
ePages developers.

## Why code quality?

In his brilliant non-technical (as in "your manager can read that") article ["Is High Quality Software Worth the Cost?"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html),
renowned software architect Martin Fowler nails this down to:
> Internal quality makes it easier to enhance software.

From his experience, the effort put into code quality starts paying for itself within a few weeks of ongoing feature development.

This is definitely something I can confirm from my day job here at ePages, where we've just recently reached a historically low open bug count.
How did we achieve that? 

## Code reviews

## Pair programming

## Unit testing

## Refactoring
